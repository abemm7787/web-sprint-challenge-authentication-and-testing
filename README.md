## Project Instructions

Dad jokes are all the rage these days! In this challenge, you will build a real wise-guy application.

Users must be able to call the `[POST] /api/auth/register` endpoint to create a new account, and the `[POST] /api/auth/login` endpoint to get a token.

We also need to make sure nobody without the token can call `[GET] /api/jokes` and gain access to our dad jokes.

We will hash the user's password using `bcryptjs`, and use JSON Web Tokens and the `jsonwebtoken` library.

### MVP

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements (further instructions are found inside each file):

- [ ] An authentication workflow with functionality for account creation and login, implemented inside `api/auth/auth-router.js`.
- [ ] Middleware used to restrict access to resources from non-authenticated requests, implemented inside `api/middleware/restricted.js`.
- [ ] A minimum of 2 tests per API endpoint, written inside `api/server.test.js`.

**IMPORTANT Notes:**

- Execute tests locally by running `npm test`.
- Do not exceed 2^8 rounds of hashing with `bcryptjs`.
- If you use environment variables make sure to provide fallbacks in the code (e.g. `process.env.SECRET || "shh"`).
- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries. Do not update existing packages.
- The database already has the `users` table, but if you run into issues, the migration is available.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
- It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Submission format

- [ ] Submit via Codegrade by committing and pushing any new changes.
- [ ] Create a pull request to merge `<firstName-lastName>` branch into `main`.
- [ ] Please don't merge your own pull request and make sure **you are on your own repo**.
- [ ] Check Codegrade for automated feedback.
- [ ] Check Codegrade on the days following the Sprint Challenge for reviewer feedback.
- [ ] Any changes pushed after the deadline will not receive any feedback.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics.

1. Differences between using _sessions_ or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication.

JSON Web Tokens handles user authentication. They also have a  
header, payload, signature. Headers are consisy of two parts; jwt, and algorithms.
The payload holds the statement about the user's creditals. 

JWTS are sent by the client. However, sessions are stored with cookie with every request.



2. What does `bcryptjs` do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?

It keeps the password secure  because it hash the database to vaildate inputs.'


3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing?


Unit testing only specifys on a target a single node of code rather than intergration, test how difffernet parts work together.


4. How does _Test Driven Development_ change the way we write applications and tests?

Itâ€™s a modern approach. Saves the project for late release or avoids projects being over budget.
To make sure changes are not impacting the unchanged feature.
